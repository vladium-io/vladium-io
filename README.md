Hi there 👋

    👨‍💻  I'm a software engineer based out of Toronto, Canada. When I'm not building applications, I'm a university student studying applied mathematics and       computer science. I believe that software should be elegant, efficient, and easy to use. 

    🔭 I’m currently working on trying to learn more about DevOps.
